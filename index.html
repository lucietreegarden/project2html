            <h2>Secret of New York State Flower's</h2>
            <div class="columncontainer">

                <p>Gardening is a hobby enjoyed by many, young and old. If you asked any experienced gardener what the
                    hardest
                    part of gardening would be, you would probably get several answers. The weather, keeping up with
                    watering or
                    pests destroying your hard grown veggies.
                <p>A common issue however, would be the care of different plants with
                    their different quirks and needs. Every gardener could name at least one plant in their collection
                    that
                    causes them constant trouble. They are easily over-watered or under-watered, they get too much sun
                    or too
                    little, in general they have a weak constitution. Plants and flowers that are not indigenous to the
                    area in
                    which you are gardening will certainly face bigger challenges than the native species.</p>
                <p>A good way to avoid
                    finicky plants is to majority, or completely, plant native species. The real secret to New York
                    state plants
                    is that native plants require less care than other non-native ornamental plants.</p>
                <p>These flowers are already
                    well established, and do not require any special care or additional nutrients.</p>
                <p> There are many benefits to
                    creating a garden space with native flora in it. The growing of native flowers provide protection
                    and food
                    for bees, birds and other native wildlife. Bees especially benefit from a healthy varied flower
                    garden. The
                    different shapes and sizes from Joe Pye and Bee Balm to Coneflowers and Goldenrod provide a healthy
                    base for
                    your backyard ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Flowers indigenous to New York will also bloom throughout the year when there is no
                    frost. In the spring we get Lilies of the Valley, in summer we get Daisies, and in the fall we get
                    Goldenrod. If you would like to create a beautiful space that also helps nourish your backyard's
                    ecosystem
                    consider planting mostly indigenous New York State flowers, the bees and other wildlife will thank
                    you.</p>
